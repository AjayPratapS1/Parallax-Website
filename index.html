        <p class="text">
          Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge,
          learning new things about the surroundings and about one's own self
          and making lots of great stories. Going for an adventure camp is the
          best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their
          ordinary lives and try new things. <br />
          <br />
          Adventure in many ways has been proven beneficial for us. Surmounting
          a challenge during an adventure is a brilliant way to leave us feeling
          positive about ourselves & thus has a positive impact on our mental
          health. Adventure & exploration can also really help us expand our
          horizons about nature, culture & more. Sometimes, it can also help us
          have a deeper insight about ourselves. This happens when we let
          ourselves loose in an unfamiliar situation. It can let our hidden
          strengths unveil and make us push our limits.

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          The bike is where I find myself. Once I clip into the peddles it
          becomes a time where I can reflect for hours at a time with no worry's
          or distractions, just the road and myself. Cycling has been a passion
          of mine since the seventh grade. I am a very competitive person and
          racing came naturally to me. As I became more of a cycling enthusiast
          I set goals and challenged myself to the fullest. My ambitions became
          very rigorous and more time consuming. Last season my goal was to be a
          top five junior in the nation and racing at the World Championships in
          France and to do this it was time to get serious. <br />
          <br />
          Since my objectives where so demanding I worked on a schedule for
          weeks that would prepare me for the task ahead. I remember sitting
          down with my coach and him telling me to keep on track of the program,
          don't do more and don't do less and your vision will become reality. I
          began my training fairly easy with simple rides and gym exercises that
          would prepare my body for the races to come. I began to feeling
          stronger every week, but my motivation strived for more. Soon enough
          18 hours a week wasn't enough and I need 22 hours a week.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using
          paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot
          launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider
          sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells.
          We will learn various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that
          follow. <br />
          <br />
          To compete in this sport, the player must have adequate license for
          paragliding and all other related documents present with him before
          the competition. The distance covered by the player is transformed
          into points through computer in IGC format.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing has been a sport enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people
          around the world. It originated in Polynesian culture as a religious
          ceremony mainly practiced by the royalty. Having been introduced from
          the Hawaiian Islands roughly 60 years ago, it has become a common
          practice in virtually every coastal beach break throughout the USA and
          numerous places around the globe. When one goes surfing there are
          three basic stages that are repeated in a surf session: getting out to
          the line up, waiting for the wave, and catching a wave and riding it
          in. <br />
          <br />
          These aspects become the key to the second stage. Patience is needed
          in order to not get frustrated with numerous possibilities, ranging
          from not being able to catch a wave to not having enough waves to
          catch. If one begins to get frustrated then that messes up their
          timing and affects their ability to get properly positioned with the
          wave in order to drop in safely. A lot of time is spent just waiting
          for the right wave to come.
